# Deep generative modelsbeyond transformers

This is the material for the talk *Deep generative modelsbeyond transformers* at the DTU Bioinformatics Section Retreat 2025.

It consists of [**slides**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oo2NuU68FfgPQni1r-RtMFMVf8sDiAPt/view?usp=share_link) and a Jupyter notebooks called `Diffusion.ipynb`. The notebooks run out of the box in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but it is also fairly easy to run them locally.

Prerequisite for the exercises are:
* The background material presented in the talk.
* Programming experience in Python using PyTorch.
